This repository contains scripts to fetch data from the Github API and generate statistics about the data. Most of the code and the readme generated with ChatGPT 😁

## Dependencies
To install the necessary dependencies, run the following command:

```
pipenv install
```

## Getting Started
Start the pipenv shell:
```
pipenv shell
```
Fetch the data from the Github API:
```
python fetch_data.py
```
Generate statistics about the fetched data:
```
python parse_files.py
```

## Additional Notes
You will need to have a valid Github access token in order to use the fetch_data.py script. You can create an access token in your Github settings under "Personal access tokens".
The statistics generated by parse_files.py are currently hardcoded. You can modify the script to customize the statistics that are generated.
